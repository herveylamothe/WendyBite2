                <img src="assignmentMaterials/Betty-White.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a house
                    in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who
                    was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur).
                    They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the
                    pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently
                    removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after
                    the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.</p>
